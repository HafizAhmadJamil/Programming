# Hello World in Java

## Introduction

This guide will help you create a basic "Hello World" application in Java. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Steps

### 1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK)

Ensure you have the JDK installed on your machine. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

### 2. Set Up Your Development Environment

You can use any text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code.

### 3. Create a New File

Create a new file named `HelloWorld.java` in your desired directory.

### 4. Write the Code

Open `HelloWorld.java` and add the following code:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### 5. Compile the Code

Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing `HelloWorld.java`, and run the following command to compile the code:

```sh
javac HelloWorld.java
```

This will generate a `HelloWorld.class` file in the same directory.

### 6. Run the Program

Run the compiled Java program with the following command:

```sh
java HelloWorld
```

You should see the output:

```sh
Hello, World!
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully created and run your first Java application. Continue exploring Java to build more complex applications.
