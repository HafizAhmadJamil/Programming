# Building Your Go Application

In this document, we will go through the steps to build the Go application you created in the previous step.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Go (latest version)
- A terminal or command prompt

## Steps to Build the Application

1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**

    Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your Go application is located. For example:

    ```sh
    cd ~/go/go_projects/hello_world
    ```

2. **Initialize the Go Module**

    If you haven't already initialized a Go module in your project, you can do so by running:

    ```sh
    go mod init hello-world
    ```

3. **Build the Application**

    To build your Go application, use the `go build` command:

    ```sh
    go build -o gohello main.go
    ```

    Replace `gohello` with the desired name for your compiled binary and `main.go` with the entry point of your application.

4. **Run the Compiled Binary**

    After building the application, you can run the compiled binary:

    ```sh
    ./gohello
    ```

## Example

Assuming your main Go file is named `main.go`, here is an example of the commands you would run:

```sh
cd ~/go/go_projects/hello_world
go mod init my-go-app
go build -o my-go-app main.go
./my-go-app
```

## Conclusion

You have successfully built and run your Go application. Continue to iterate and improve your code as needed.
